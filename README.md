This is an in-progress proof of concept application which uses oAuth and the youtube data api 
to gain access to a user's private youtube playlist data and then shuffles and plays those videos. 
The project proved that it is viable and the next steps are to port this vanilla JS to NEXTjs and 
add functionality to select any playlist the user has access to. Additionally, as I coded this application
I found that Oauth 2.0 was a deprecated library compared to GIS, so I would like to explore converting to 
the GIS library.
